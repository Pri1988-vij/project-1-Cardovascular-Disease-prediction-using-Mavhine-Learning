# project-1-Cardovascular-Disease-prediction-using-Mavhine-Learning

*In this project The main objective is to find the best algorithm with maximum accuracy prediction.
*The given data contains missing values and errors, we have to preprocess the data and find insights by plotting Graphs.
*To preprocess the data we can apply label encoding or onehot encoding.
* to plot the graphs we can use matplotlib and seaborn.
*Next we have to apply various algorithms like Linear regression,logistic Regression ,Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, KNN ,SVM, Kmeans to find which algorithm gives best accuray.
*The packages involved are
a)Numpy - Arithmetic operations
b)Matplotlib - To visualize the data
c)pandas - create and manipulate data
c) scikitlearn - predictive data analysis
d)seaborn - to visualize data
* the differnt plots used are scatterplot, lineplot, piechart ,histogram, barchart
