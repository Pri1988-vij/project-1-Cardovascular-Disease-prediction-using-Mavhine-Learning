# project-1-Cardovascular-Disease-prediction-using-Mavhine-Learning

In this project The main objective is to find the best algorithm with maximum accuracy prediction.
The given data contains missing values and errors, we have to preprocess the data and find insights by plotting Graphs.
Next we have to apply various algorithms like Linear regression,logistic Regression ,Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, KNN ,SVM, Kmeans to find which algorithm gives best accuray.
The packages involved are
a)Numpy - Arithmetic operations
b)Matplotlib - To visualize the data
c)pandas - create and manipulate data
c) scikitlearn - predictive data analysis
